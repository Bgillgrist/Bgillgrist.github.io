# TrackMan Data Analysis Tool

An R Shiny app for analyzing baseball TrackMan data. This project was completed with the Arroyo Seco Saints over the summer 2024 season. It was created as a way for me to better visualize the TrackMan csv's in a more people friendly format.

# Explanation and Usage:

There are 5 sections to the code once you upload the csv files:
1. Anova: You can compare player stats in differnet situations to see if there is a difference in performance for different situations.
2. Player Comparison: Allows you to compare multiple player's stats side by side.
3. Stat Leaders: Outputs the leaders in whatever stat you select (When Pitcher is selected you can choose what pitch type)
4. Pitcher Report: Outputs a report for a selected pitcher with key stats, metrics, and heat maps.
5. Hitter Report: Outputs a report for a selected batter with key stats, metrics, and spray charts.
