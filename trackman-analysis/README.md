This is an R Shiny app to analyze TrackMan .csv's. The code allows for an upload process where you can upload as many games as you would like. There are 5 sections to the code: 
1. Anova: You can compare player stats in differnet situations to see if there is a difference in performance for different situations.
2. Player Comparison: Allows you to compare multiple player's stats side by side.
3. Stat Leaders: Outputs the leaders in whatever stat you select (When Pitcher is selected you can choose what pitch type)
4. Pitcher Report: Outputs a report for a selected pitcher with key stats, metrics, and heat maps.
5. Hitter Report: Outputs a report for a selected batter with key stats, metrics, and spray charts.

This project was mostly completed but never fully finished and checked for accuracy and fine tuned. A data visualization project with similar graphics will be uploaded soon at the end of this semester.
