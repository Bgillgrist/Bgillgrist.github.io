# College Football Game Predictor

Originally created to predict the outcome of South Carolina Gamecocks football games, the project has recently expanded to apply to any FBS college football team. The example here is the original version meant to predict only South Carolina games as it is a fully complete project.

# Explanation and Usage:

This project utilized Google Collaboratory to run python code from files stored in my Google Drive. The code imports a csv file of South Carolina football game data from 2023-2010 and models the upcoming game based on that data. There are three models in the code: win probability, South Carolina score prediction, and opponent score prediction. After calculating these, the program will simulate the season 50,000 times and calculate the probability of each number of wins for the rest of the season.

These predictions were posted on the largest South Carolina Gamecocks fan page @thegamecockinsider which can be viewed here:
