# South Carolina Football Game Predictor

This is the original project I created working for The Gamecock Insider during the 2024 college football season. The goal of this project is to predict the outcome of South Carolina football games using historical data. This project eventually expanded to predict the outcome of any college football game and that project is also listed in my portfolio.

# Explanation and Usage:

This project utilized Google Collaboratory to run python code from files stored in my Google Drive. The code imports a csv file of South Carolina football game data from 2023-2010 and models the upcoming game based on that data. There are three models in the code: win probability, South Carolina score prediction, and opponent score prediction. After calculating these, the program will simulate the season 50,000 times and calculate the probability of each number of wins for the rest of the season.

These predictions were posted on the largest South Carolina Gamecocks fan page @thegamecockinsider
